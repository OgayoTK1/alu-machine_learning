0. Sigma is for Sum

Mandatory task demonstrating summation notation (sigma).

This module provides two functions to compute the sum of consecutive
integers from 'start' to 'end' (inclusive):

- summation_loop: Uses a for loop to directly simulate the sigma summation.
- summation_formula: Uses the closed-form arithmetic series formula:

  sum_{k=m}^{n} k = n(n+1)/2 - (m-1)m/2

The functions are designed to handle the required examples:
1. sum from 3 to 5 → 12
2. sum from 3 to 4 → 7
3. sum from 2 to 5 → 14
4. sum from 2 to 4 → 9
