1. The Greeks pronounce it sEEgma

Mandatory task demonstrating that the index of summation is a dummy variable.

The symbol is Σ (sigma), but the index variable below it can be any letter
(commonly i, j, or k). Changing the index letter does not change the sum.

This module provides two functions to compute the sum of consecutive
integers from 'start' to 'end' (inclusive):

- summation_loop: Uses a for loop with index variable 'i' to simulate the summation.
- summation_formula: Uses the closed-form arithmetic series formula
  (independent of the index variable):

  sum_{k=m}^{n} k = n(n+1)/2 - (m-1)m/2

Examples of possible general terms (showing different index letters and forms):
1. Constant term: 90 - 20
2. Linear in i: 36i - 20
3. Linear in k (negative coefficient): 90 - 8k
4. Mixed indices: 36i - 8k (this form would typically appear in a double sum)

The functions here use consecutive integers (term = index) to illustrate
that the choice of index letter is arbitrary.
