### 0. Sigma is for Sum (Mandatory)

**Objective**  
Introduce the summation notation (Σ) and demonstrate its equivalence to adding terms.

**Task**  
The script `math/calculus/0-sigma_is_for_sum.py` computes the following sums:

1. $$ \sum_{k=3}^{5} k = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 $$
2. $$ \sum_{k=3}^{4} k = 3 + 4 = 7 $$
3. $$ \sum_{k=2}^{5} k = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14 $$
4. $$ \sum_{k=2}^{4} k = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 $$

It implements:
- A loop to directly simulate the summation
- The closed-form formula for the sum of an arithmetic series

**File**  
- `math/calculus/0-sigma_is_for_sum.py`

**Requirements Compliance**  
- Executable with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Compatible with Python 3.5
- Follows pycodestyle (version 2.5)
- Full documentation for module and functions
- No external imports
- Ends with a newline

**Execution**  
```bash
./math/calculus/0-sigma_is_for_sum.py
