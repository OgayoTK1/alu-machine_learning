5. A log on the fire

Mandatory task introducing the natural logarithm and its special property.

The natural logarithm (ln(x) = log_e(x)) is unique among logarithmic bases
because its derivative is simply 1/x — a clean and elegant result that makes
it the preferred choice in calculus and machine learning (e.g., in entropy,
loss functions, and continuous growth models).

This is why it's "the log on the fire" — the "hot" or special one!

This module provides two ways to obtain the derivative of ln(x) at a point x > 0:

- analytical_ln_derivative: Direct closed-form formula → exact 1/x
- numerical_ln_derivative: Central difference approximation using math.log
  (verifies the analytical result computationally)
