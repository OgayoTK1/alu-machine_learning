# ALU Machine Learning - Math: Plotting

This repository contains a series of Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental data visualization techniques using **Matplotlib**. The project focuses on creating various types of plots (line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, stacked bar charts, and composite figures) while adhering to strict formatting requirements.

The scripts are designed to run on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** with **Python 3.5**, **NumPy 1.15**, and **Matplotlib 3.0**.

## These are the learning objectives of this project:

- What is a plot?
- What is a scatter plot, line graph, bar graph, and histogram?
- What is Matplotlib?
- How to plot data with Matplotlib
- How to label a plot (title, axes)
- How to scale axes (linear, logarithmic, custom limits)
- How to plot multiple datasets on the same figure
- How to create subplots and composite figures
- How to create legends, customize colors, line styles, and bar properties

## Here are the requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.5)
- All files must end with a new line
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code must follows **pycodestyle (version 2.5)**
- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation
  ```bash
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
